<p>Hello!</p>
<p>May I present you with a short game of lights, where the user "chases after" the running light using the mouse. Any time the mouse cursor is over a light bulb, the next bulb switches on and the current one turns off. When the user tries to touch the lit bulb with the mouse cursor the light should skip to the next.</p>
